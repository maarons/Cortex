= Platform support =
Cortex should run on any UNIX-like OS, especially any GNU based OS should be
fine.

= Compilation =

== Haskell ==
Cortex needs a compiler implementing Haskell 2010 standard and several language
extensions (grep for "LANGUAGE" in sources to get a list).  GHC 7.4 is
recommended, but other compiler could probably be used.  Other compilers were
not tested and are not supported though.

== Python ==
Parts written in Python should work with any 2.7 or 3.2+ compatible
interpreter/compiler.

== Shell ==
`build clean` requires a shell that expands `**` to every file under current
directory, so currently the shell is hard set to `/bin/zsh`.

== Helpers ==
`Utils/autobuild` will rebuild Cortex when any Haskell source file changes, it
can be used similarly to autobuild functionality from IDEs like Eclipse.

= Usage =

== Middleware ==
If you have a lot of clients using Middleware message bus, you might want to
raise file descriptor limit (`umimit -n`).  Otherwise Middleware won't be able
to process all the connections.
